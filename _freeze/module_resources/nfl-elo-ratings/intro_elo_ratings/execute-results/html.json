This file contains guided exercises demonstrating how to implement Elo ratings from scratch in `R`.\n\nWe'll use a subset of the [NFL Game Outcomes dataset available on the SCORE Sports Data Repository](https://data.scorenetwork.org/football/nfl-game-outcomes.html), only considering games during the 2023-24 season. The following code chunk reads in the larger dataset and filters down to only include games during the 2023-24 season:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Need to have the tidyverse installed prior to starting!\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnfl_games <- read_csv(\"https://data.scorenetwork.org/data/nfl_mahomes_era_games.csv\") |>\n  filter(season == 2023)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs indicated in the [overview page for the larger dataset](https://data.scorenetwork.org/football/nfl-game-outcomes.html), each row in the dataset corresponds to a single game played during the 2023-24 season:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl_games\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 285 × 10\n   season game_id      game_type  week home_team away_team home_score away_score\n    <dbl> <chr>        <chr>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>          <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1   2023 2023_01_DET… REG           1 KC        DET               20         21\n 2   2023 2023_01_CAR… REG           1 ATL       CAR               24         10\n 3   2023 2023_01_HOU… REG           1 BAL       HOU               25          9\n 4   2023 2023_01_CIN… REG           1 CLE       CIN               24          3\n 5   2023 2023_01_JAX… REG           1 IND       JAX               21         31\n 6   2023 2023_01_TB_… REG           1 MIN       TB                17         20\n 7   2023 2023_01_TEN… REG           1 NO        TEN               16         15\n 8   2023 2023_01_SF_… REG           1 PIT       SF                 7         30\n 9   2023 2023_01_ARI… REG           1 WAS       ARI               20         16\n10   2023 2023_01_GB_… REG           1 CHI       GB                20         38\n# ℹ 275 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: game_outcome <dbl>, score_diff <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote the `game_type` column indicates if the game was during the regular season (`REG`), or during the playoffs with the different values indicating the different playoff rounds:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(nfl_games$game_type)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCON DIV REG  SB  WC \n  2   4 272   1   6 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `week` column just increases in the correct order, which will be convenient for implementing Elo ratings over the course of the NFL season.\n\n## Background Information\n\nElo ratings were created by physicist [Arpad Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpad_Elo) in the 1960s for rating chess players. The main idea behind Elo ratings is to create **an exchange in rating points** between players (or teams) after a match. The simplest version of this system was constructed to be a **zero-sum** rating, such that the winner gains `x` points while the same number of `x` points are subtracted from the loser's rating. If the win was expected, the winner receives fewer points than if the win was unexpected (i.e., an upset) - where the expectation is set prior to the match. This system results in a **dynamic rating** that is adjusted for opponent quality.\n\n## Method Details\n\nWe're going to consider a simple version of Elo ratings in the context of measuring NFL team strength via a *rating*. Let the rating for the home team be $R_{\\text{home}}$ and the away team rating be $R_{\\text{away}}$. Then the **expected score** for the home team $E_{\\text{home}}$ is calculated as:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text{home}} = \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\left(R_{\\text{away}}-R_{\\text{home}}\\right) / 400}},\n$$\n\nand the **expected score** for the away team $E_{\\text{away}}$ is computed in a similar manner:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text{away}} = \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\left(R_{\\text{home}}-R_{\\text{away}}\\right) / 400}}.\n$$ These expected scores represent the **probability of winning**[^1], e.g., $E_{\\text{home}}$ represents the probability of winning for the home team.\n\n[^1]: Technically, it represents the probability of winning and *half* the probability of drawing, but for our purposes we will just treat this as the probability of winning due to how rare draws are in the NFL.\n\nThe choice of 10 and 400 in the denominator may appear arbitrary at first, but they correspond to:\n\n-   a logistic curve (thus bounded by 0 and 1) with base 10, and\n-   a *scaling factor* of 400 which can be *tuned* to yield better predictions (discussed in more detail below).\n\nA more general representation of the expected score would replace the choice of 10 with some constant (e.g., $e$) and replace 400 with a tune-able quantity $d$. For now though we will just use 10 and 400 since they are the original choices.\n\nWhile the above quantities represent the expectation of a game between teams with ratings $R_{\\text{home}}$ and $R_{\\text{away}}$, we need a step to update the ratings after observing the game outcome. We can update we update the ratings for the home team based on the *observed score* $S_{\\text{home}}$:\n\n$$\nR^{\\text{new}}_{\\text{home}} = R_{\\text{home}} + K \\cdot (S_{\\text{home}} - E_{\\text{home}})\n$$\n\nThe observed score $S_{\\text{home}}$ is based on the game outcome such that,\n\n-   $S_{\\text{home}} = 1$ if the home team wins,\n-   $S_{\\text{home}} = 0.5$ if it is a draw, or\n-   $S_{\\text{home}} = 0$ if the home team loses.\n\nWe compute the updated rating for the away team $R^{\\text{new}}_{\\text{away}}$ in a similar manner, by replacing home team quantities with those with respect to the away team.\n\nThe quantity $K$ is known as the **update factor**, indicating the maximum number of Elo rating points a team gains from winning a single game (and how many points are subtracted if they lose). This is a **tuning parameter**, which ideally should be selected to yield optimal predictive performance.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Thought Exercise\n\n**QUESTION:** Given the above equation for $R^{\\text{new}}_{\\text{home}}$, what do you think will happen as you increase $K$? Does a single game cause a larger or smaller change on a team's rating? Likewise, what do you think will happen if you decrease $K$? Describe what you expect to observe in 1-3 sentences.\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n**INSERT ANSWER HERE.**\n:::\n\nAlthough the details are beyond the scope of this module, there is a relationship between this Elo ratings update formula with [stochastic gradient descent for logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Formal_derivation_for_win/loss_games).\n\n## Learn by Doing\n\nWe'll now proceed to implement Elo ratings for NFL teams during the 2023-24 season in `R`.\n\n### Calculating and Updating Ratings\n\n::: callout-warning\n## WARNING: Code chunk evaluation is turned off\n\nYou will need to delete `#| eval:false` from every code chunk in the remainder of this module in order to run the code after you fill in the missing portions in the Active Exercises.\n:::\n\nWe will start by creating two helper functions to compute the expected scores and updated ratings after a game.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Active Exercise\n\nFirst, based on the above formulas for expected score, complete the function `calc_expected_score` that takes in as input a `team_rating` and `opp_team_rating` then returns the expected score for the `team` relative to the `opp_team`. For ease, your function should use the base 10 logistic curve and scaling factor of 400 as fixed quantities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalc_expected_score <- function(team_rating, opp_team_rating) {\n  # INSERT CODE HERE\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n**QUESTION:** Using your function `calc_expected_score`, what is the expected score for a team with a rating of 1400 playing against an opposing team with a rating of 1600?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# INSERT CODE FOR ANSWER HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n**INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Active Exercise\n\nNext, complete the `calc_new_rating` function that takes in an initial `team_rating`, the `observed_score` and `expected_score` with respect to that team, along with a choice of the `update_factor` $K$ to return the new rating. For now, we will just consider $K = 20$ as the default choice.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalc_new_rating <- function(team_rating, observed_score, expected_score,\n                            update_factor = 20) {\n  # INSERT CODE HERE\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n**QUESTION:** Using your functions `calc_expected_score` and `calc_new_rating` together, what is the new rating for team that had an initial rating of 1300 but beat an opponent with a rating of 1700? You should answer this question using $K = 20$, and pass in the output of `calc_expected_score` to be the `expected_score`. How does the observed change in the team's rating compare to the maximum number of points the rating can change by?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# INSERT CODE FOR ANSWER HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n**INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n:::\n\n### NFL Elo Ratings\n\nNow with the basics, let's move on to perform these calculations over the entire season, updating a table to include each team's Elo rating following every game. We can implement this using a `for` loop to proceed through each game in the `nfl_games` table, looking up each team's previous ratings and performing the above calculations.\n\nPrior to beginning this loop, we will set-up a table initializing each team with a rating of 1500. This a naive approach since we likely have prior knowledge about each team's strength before the start of the season, but we'll discuss this in more detail at the end of the module. For now, we'll use 1500 since it is a common choice for initializing Elo ratings. The code chunk below initializes this starting table of ratings beginning with an imaginary week `0`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl_elo_ratings <- tibble(team = unique(nfl_games$home_team),\n                          elo_rating = 1500,\n                          week = 0)\nnfl_elo_ratings\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n## Active Exercise\n\n**QUESTION:** The code chunk below outlines the `for` loop to be used in updating team ratings after every game during the 2023-24 season in the `nfl_games` dataset. Fill in the missing portions code marked by `???` using your above `calc_expected_score` and `calc_new_rating` functions. While this module does not cover all of the basics of [`tidyverse` data wrangling](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html?_gl=1*1wfj8xl*_ga*NDE2OTUyOTg3LjE3MTMwMjgzMzI.*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTcyMDQ4ODk0Ny40LjAuMTcyMDQ4ODk0Ny4wLjAuMA..), the code comments should help make the various steps clear.\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (game_i in 1:nrow(nfl_games)) {\n   \n  # Grab the home and away teams in the current game:\n  home_team <- nfl_games$home_team[game_i]\n  away_team <- nfl_games$away_team[game_i]\n  # What was the observed score by the home team?\n  observed_home_score <- nfl_games$game_outcome[game_i]\n  # Retain the week number for this game:\n  game_week <- nfl_games$week[game_i]\n  \n  # What was each team's rating from their latest game in the\n  # current elo ratings table, starting with the home team:\n  home_rating <- nfl_elo_ratings |>\n    filter(team == home_team) |>\n    # Sort in descending order\n    arrange(desc(week)) |>\n    # Grab the latest game\n    slice(1) |>\n    # Just return the elo rating\n    pull(elo_rating)\n  \n  # Same thing for away team\n  away_rating <- nfl_elo_ratings |>\n    filter(team == away_team) |>\n    arrange(desc(week)) |>\n    slice(1) |>\n    pull(elo_rating)\n  \n  # Now get their new ratings, starting with the home team:\n  new_home_rating <- ???\n  # And repeating for the away team using the opposite input as home team:\n  new_away_rating <- ???\n  \n  # Set up a table containing the updated ratings for each team after the game\n  updated_ratings <- tibble(team = c(home_team, away_team),\n                            elo_rating = c(new_home_rating, new_away_rating),\n                            # Store the week index of the game\n                            week = rep(game_week, 2))\n  \n  # Add each teams new ratings to the current elo ratings table by row binding:\n  nfl_elo_ratings <- nfl_elo_ratings |>\n    bind_rows(updated_ratings)\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nAfter you run the completed `for` loop, you can view and inspect the ratings in different ways. For example, the following code chunk will return the final rating for each after the completion of the entire season of games:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl_elo_ratings |>\n  group_by(team) |>\n  # Since some teams make the playoffs, need to find the rating \n  # for each team's final weeK:\n  summarize(final_rating = elo_rating[which.max(week)]) |>\n  # Sort in descending order of the rating so the best team is first:\n  arrange(desc(final_rating))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## BONUS: Expand To Visualize Ratings\n\nIt is often helpful to visualize how the team ratings are changing over time. While this module does not cover the details about the [`ggplot2` visualization library](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), the following code creates a line for each team:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl_elo_ratings |>\n  # Input the dataset into ggplot, mapping the week to the x-axis and\n  # the elo_rating to the y-axis, colored by team:\n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = elo_rating, color = team)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Week\", y = \"Elo rating\",\n       title = \"NFL Elo ratings in 2023-24 season\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile we can observe ratings changing over the season for every team, this visualization is less than ideal. Instead one could take advantage of the team colors available using the [`load_teams` function from the `nflverse`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/reference/load_teams.html) This is a little more involved, but here is example way to create a figure highlighting teams in each division separately (this requires installing the [`nflreadr`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/), [`ggrepel`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html), and [`cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nnfl_team_colors <- load_teams() |>\n  dplyr::select(team_abbr, team_division, team_color)\n\n# Create a dataset that has each team's final Elo rating\nnfl_team_final <- nfl_elo_ratings |>\n  group_by(team) |>\n  summarize(week = max(week),\n            elo_rating = elo_rating[which.max(week)],\n            .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  inner_join(nfl_team_colors, by = c(\"team\" = \"team_abbr\")) |>\n  arrange(desc(elo_rating))\n \n# Need ggrepel:\nlibrary(ggrepel)\ndivision_plots <- \n  lapply(sort(unique(nfl_team_final$team_division)),\n         function(nfl_division) {                            \n             # Pull out the teams in the division\n             division_teams <- nfl_team_final |>\n               filter(team_division == nfl_division) |>\n               mutate(team = fct_reorder(team, desc(elo_rating))) \n             \n             # Get the Elo ratings data just for these teams:\n             division_data <- nfl_elo_ratings |>\n               filter(team %in% division_teams$team) |>\n               mutate(team = factor(team,\n                                    levels = levels(division_teams$team))) |>\n               # Make text labels for them:\n               group_by(team) |>\n               mutate(team_label = if_else(week == max(week),\n                                           as.character(team), \n                                           NA_character_)) |>\n               ungroup()\n             \n             # Now make the full plot\n             nfl_elo_ratings |>\n               # Plot all of the other teams as gray lines:\n               filter(!(team %in% division_teams$team)) |>\n               ggplot(aes(x = week, y = elo_rating, group = team)) +\n               geom_line(color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.5) +\n               # But display the division teams with their colors:\n               geom_line(data = division_data,\n                         aes(x = week, y = elo_rating, group = team,\n                             color = team)) +\n               geom_label_repel(data = division_data,\n                                aes(label = team_label,\n                                    color = team), nudge_x = 1, na.rm = TRUE,\n                                direction = \"y\") +\n               scale_color_manual(values = division_teams$team_color,\n                                  guide = FALSE) +\n               theme_bw() +\n               labs(x = \"Week\", y = \"Elo rating\",\n                    title = paste0(\"Division: \", nfl_division)) \n         })\n# Display the grid of plots with cowplot!\nlibrary(cowplot)\nplot_grid(plotlist = division_plots, ncol = 2, align = \"hv\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Assessing the Ratings\n\nThe result of the `for` loop from above provides us with a dataset that contains the rating for each team after every week. But how do we know if we can trust this approach for estimating team ratings? We can assess the **predictive performance** of the Elo ratings based on the estimated probabilities for every game given the team's ratings entering the game.\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Challenge: Missing Team ratings\n\nTo demonstrate this, we will first need to fill in for missing weeks for teams due to bye weeks. You can see in the output from the table counts below that during certain weeks there are fewer than 32 teams with ratings (this is not a concern in the values post week 18 since that corresponds to playoffs):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(nfl_elo_ratings$week)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe follow code chunks fixes this issue by iterating over each possible week, and fills in missing week ratings with the last available rating. *There are multiple ways to do this! The details of the code are not necessarily important for understanding how to assess the accuracy of Elo ratings but rather a practical concern with implementation.

The code chunk below initializes these copies, and also adds 1 to the `week` column to indicate which week to use team's rating for when predicting:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhome_elo_ratings <- complete_nfl_elo_ratings |>\n  mutate(week = week + 1) |>\n  # Rename the team and elo_rating columns\n  rename(home_team = team,\n         home_elo_rating = elo_rating)\n\n# And repeat for away teams:\naway_elo_ratings <- complete_nfl_elo_ratings |>\n  mutate(week = week + 1) |>\n  rename(away_team = team,\n         away_elo_rating = elo_rating)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we can join the ratings stored in these two tables to the `nfl_games` table to estimate the expected outcome with respect to the home team. The following code chunk demonstrates how to `left_join` the team ratings, and then compute the probability of winning for the home team:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nupd_nfl_games <- nfl_games |>\n  # First join home team by the team abbreviation and week\n  left_join(home_elo_ratings, by = c(\"home_team\", \"week\")) |>\n  # Repeat for away team ratings:\n  left_join(away_elo_ratings, by = c(\"away_team\", \"week\")) |>\n  # And now compute the expectation, home_win_prob:\n  mutate(home_win_prob = calc_expected_score(home_elo_rating,\n                                             away_elo_rating))\nupd_nfl_games\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now assess the use of the Elo rating system with the computed `home_win_prob` values relative to the observed `game_outcome`. While there are a number of ways to evaluate the performance of a probability estimate, in this module we will consider the use of the [**Brier score**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) which is computed as the mean squared difference between the observed outcome and predicted probabilities. In the context of our Elo rating system notation, the Brier score is computed across $N$ games as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} (S_{\\text{home},i} - E_{\\text{home},i})^2\n$$ where the use of subscript $i$ refers to the outcome and expectation for the home team in game $i$.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Thought Exercise\n\n**QUESTION:** Given the above formula for computing the Brier score, what do you think is a better indicator predictive accuracy: a lower or higher Brier score?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n**INSERT ANSWER HERE.**\n:::\n\nWe will compute the Brier score using our NFL Elo ratings, and compare the performance to always using a 50/50 probability for every game, i.e., as if we never learned any information over the course of the season.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Active Exercise\n\n**QUESTION:** Compute and report the Brier score for both: (1) the Elo rating based `home_win_prob` and (2) as if you predicted the probability to be 0.5 for every game.

Are you surprised by the outcome?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# INSERT CODE FOR ANSWER HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n**INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n:::\n\nAlthough you have just implemented and evaluated the use of Elo ratings in the context of NFL games, so far we have just considered an update factor of $K = 20$. But is there a more optimal choice?\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Challenging Active Exercise\n\n**QUESTION:** You will now proceed to different choices for the update factor. Rather than tediously code the entire process from above multiple times, we will wrap up the code to compute the Brier score for a given choice of $K$ inside a function `compute_elo_brier_score`. The code chunk in the **ANSWER** portion below provides you with a template to fill out, this function takes in both the `nfl_games` data and input for the `update_factor` $K$. Once you have completed the function, compute and report the Brier score for $K =$ 5, 20, 50, and 100 (your value for $K = 20$ should match the previous output). Which choice of $K$ yields the best Brier score?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\nThe following is the complete version of the template code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompute_elo_brier_score <- function(games_table, update_factor) {\n  # First initialize the ratings:\n  ???\n  \n  # Loop through to construct the Elo ratings:\n  ???\n  \n  # Fill in the missing ratings for teams:\n  ???\n  \n  \n  # Join the home and away team ratings for every game to get the probabilities:\n  ???\n  \n  # Compute and return the Brier score\n  ???\n}\n\n# Return the Brier score across the values for K:\ncompute_elo_brier_score(nfl_games, 5)\ncompute_elo_brier_score(nfl_games, 20)\ncompute_elo_brier_score(nfl_games, 50)\ncompute_elo_brier_score(nfl_games, 100)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n:::\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou have now learned the basics behind the popular Elo rating system in sports, including the steps for implementing Elo ratings from scratch in `R` to measure NFL team strength. Furthermore, you have a basic understanding for how to assess the predictive performance of the ratings using Brier score and how this can be used to *tune* the choice the update factor $K$. Although we only considered the ratings for the 2023-24 season, you could observe how ratings change across a [larger dataset of games spanning the Patrick Mahomes' era](https://data.scorenetwork.org/football/nfl-game-outcomes.html).\n\nHowever, there are a number of additional questions and considerations that we did not cover in this module such as:\n\n-   **Initial Elo ratings**: Rather than using 1500 as the initial values for every team, you could use a more informed starting point such as [Neil Paine's NFL Elo ratings](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/2023-nfl-elo-ratings-and-win-projections) which start at the beginning of the league history.\n\n-   **New season? New roster?**: We just demonstrated Elo ratings within one season, but what do we do across multiple seasons? Do we simply just use the final rating from the previous season as the initial rating in the following season? But teams change rosters so we likely want to make some correction.\n\n-   **Scaling factor**: We fixed the scaling factor to be 400 in this module, but we could also tune this quantity in the same manner as $K$.\n\n-   **What games matter in assessment?**: Although we walked through assessing the performance Elo ratings performance with Brier scores, we treated every game equally in this calculation. What if we wanted to tune our Elo rating system to yield the most optimal predictions in the playoffs, and ignore performance in the first few weeks of the season?\n\n-   **What about margin of victory?**: We only considered win/loss in a binary manner, but the score differential in a game may be informative of team strength. [There are extensions to handle margin of victory in Elo ratings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207020300157), but details are beyond the scope of this module.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, you now have the capability in implement Elo ratings in practice across a variety of sports.\n\nYou may find these additional resources helpful:\n\n-   For football fans, you can simulate NFL seasons using your Elo ratings with the [`nflseedR` package](https://nflseedr.com/articles/nflsim.html).\n\n-   The [`elo` package](https://eheinzen.github.io/elo/) in `R` provides convenient functions for computing Elo ratings, similar to the functions we defined above.\n\n-   An overview of the popular [Glicko rating system by statistician Mark Glickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system) that quantifies uncertainty about the ratings.\n",
